# AGENTS.md

Operational guide for AI agents working in this repo. Complements `README.md`
(which covers product + local setup) with the non-obvious conventions you must
follow to avoid breaking things. Read this before editing.

## Architecture in one breath

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, deployed to **Netlify**.
- **Two backends over ONE Neon Postgres DB**:
  - `server/index.cjs` — the long-running Node/Express/**WebSocket** server. Owns
    realtime (`/backend/ws`), agent daemon orchestration, and the runtime schema
    bootstrap (`ensureRuntimeSchema`). Deployed to **Fly** (`fly deploy`).
  - `netlify/functions/backend.mjs` — the serverless HTTP mirror. Same DB, same
    routes, **no WebSockets**, **no independent DDL**.
  - `shared/backend-core.cjs` — logic both backends import (auth, RBAC table
    access, rate limiters, param binding). Put shared helpers here, not in one
    backend.
- Frontend talks to the backend through `src/lib/backendClient.ts` (a
  Supabase-shaped query builder: `.from(table).select/insert/update/delete/eq`).
  The builder supports `eq`/`not` filters only — no `in`, no `lt`/`gt`.

## Schema changes: update THREE places (the #1 footgun)

A schema change is only correct when all three agree, or a fresh DB drifts:

1. **Runtime bootstrap** — `server/index.cjs` `ensureRuntimeSchema`: idempotent
   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`.
2. **Canonical schema** — `database/neon-schema.sql` (what `npm run db:neon:push`
   applies to a fresh Neon DB).
3. **Migration** — a new `supabase/migrations/<UTC-timestamp>_name.sql`.

If a column is workspace-scoped, also confirm the table is in the access
allowlists in `shared/backend-core.cjs` (`ALLOWED_TABLES`,
`WORKSPACE_SCOPED_TABLES`, `DB_TABLE_ACCESS`). Array columns (e.g. `uuid[]`) need
`ARRAY_COLUMNS_BY_TABLE` + the `toPgArrayLiteral` bind path in BOTH backends —
postgres.js will not array-serialize a raw JS array bound via `.unsafe`.

## Realtime

Clients receive live updates via `notifyDbSubscribers(table, eventType, rows)` in
`server/index.cjs`, which fans DB-change events to subscribed WebSocket clients.
Streaming agent output works by inserting a `Thinking …` placeholder message,
then `UPDATE`-ing its content (each update broadcasts). Heavy fields are stripped
from the fanout by `sanitizeRealtimeRow` — add to it, don't broadcast large bodies.

## Tests (two runners)

- `npm test` — Node's built-in runner over `tests/*.test.cjs` (backend/integration,
  mock DBs). ~363 tests.
- `npm run test:unit` — Vitest over `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts` (frontend/pure). ~207.
- Keep both green. `tests/cursorbuddy-manifest.test.cjs` asserts guided-tour
  selectors exist in source — if you remove/rename a selector it references,
  update the tour JSON (`public/.well-known/cursorbuddy.json`) + that test.
- Known: `npm run lint` has ~6 PRE-EXISTING errors in `server/index.cjs`
  (`_`-prefixed unused vars). Don't claim a clean lint run; verify your own files.

## Verify before you ship (every change)

```bash
npm run typecheck            # tsc, must be 0
node --check server/index.cjs        # if you touched the server
node --check netlify/functions/backend.mjs   # if you touched netlify
npm test && npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

## Deploy targets

- **Frontend / netlify routes** → `netlify deploy --build --prod`.
- **WebSocket server / daemon orchestration** (`server/index.cjs`) → `fly deploy`.
- A change to `server/index.cjs` needs **Fly**; a frontend-only change needs
  **Netlify**; a change touching both (e.g. a shared-core edit) needs both.
- After deploying, confirm `git rev-parse HEAD` matches the pushed `main`.

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding file's style: 2-space indent, its semicolon convention,
  `cn()` for class merging, shadcn/ui primitives already imported in the file.
- No new npm dependencies without a strong reason. Drag-and-drop is native HTML5
  (`draggable` + `onDragStart/onDragOver/onDrop`) or pointer events — see
  `src/components/windows/ThreadWidgetRail.tsx` and `TasksWindowContent.tsx`.
- The releasable CLI is `agent/agensis-cli` (a `file:` dep of the root). The root
  package is the app.
- User-facing rich text is sanitized through `src/lib/sanitize.ts` (DOMPurify) at
  every render/paste boundary.
